In this short report famous the binomial identity \[\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}=2^n\]
is generalized such that relation between Pascal's triangle and volume of \emph{m}-dimension \textit{n}-length
hypercubes is shown.
Where $\binom{n}{k}$ are binomial coefficients and $(m, \ n)$ are positive integers.
